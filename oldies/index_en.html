    <p class="lead"><strong>Oldies</strong>—the past does not only fade away; it returns in moments.</p>

    <h2>Fragments of memory</h2>
    <p>
      The day of onset, the nights in hospital, the unease after discharge.  
      Clarity dims yet resurfaces suddenly. Accept them rather than deny.  
      <em>The past coexists</em> as part of the present.
    </p>

    <h2>Narrating</h2>
    <p>
      Line the events, render them into words.  
      In becoming narrative, scattered pieces join into a path.  
      Retelling is a craft of self-understanding.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing with others</h2>
    <p>
      Reunion with friends, talks with family, reflections with clinicians.  
      Offering fragments lets them intersect with other stories.  
      Both empathy and dissonance give rise to new meaning.
    </p>

    <h2>Handing to the future</h2>
    <p>
      Past experience equips future readiness. Failures and gains alike, leave them in notes.  
      They are gifts for others who may face it, and reassurance for oneself.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I write</h2>
    <p>
      Oldies is not about “being old” but about “being handed down.”  
      Holding former selves, we choose anew.  
      Records are bridges into tomorrow.
    </p>

      Note: This is a personal narrative, not medical guidance.
