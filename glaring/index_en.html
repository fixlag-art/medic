  <main class="container prose">
    <p class="lead"><strong>Glaring</strong>—once I knew it was “abnormal,” a chain of decisions followed.</p>

    <h2>The contour of pain</h2>
    <p>
      The outline sharpens. Where in the body, in which posture does it intensify?
      On inhalation, on exhalation? I quietly check the changes with movement,
      converting them into <em>describable words</em>: stabbing, tightening, tearing.
      Such metaphors help when sharing with clinicians.
    </p>

    <h2>Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      Respiratory rate, pulse, blood pressure, skin temperature.  
      If a device is available, record the numbers; if not, log the felt shifts.
      Always mark the time—<strong>a timeline log</strong> is the backbone of explanation.
    </p>

    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>
      Send a brief update: “This is how it is now. Next, I’ll do this.”  
      Separate subjective from factual. Reduce ambiguity.  
      Even if no reply comes, leave a record you can review later.
    </p>

    <h2>Reducing decision fatigue</h2>
    <p>
      In pain, the more choices you face, the more errors you risk.  
      Narrow them beforehand: <em>criteria for calling EMS or self-transfer, which hospital, what to bring</em>.  
      Follow a checklist rather than improvisation.
    </p>

    <h2>Handover to clinicians</h2>
    <p>
      “Time of onset,” “character of pain,” “history and meds,” “factors that worsen or ease.”  
      Present these four first. Keep it short, answer questions concisely.  
      Do not let words steal time from tests and treatment.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I write</h2>
    <p>
      This chapter is a record of <em>ways to stay organized even while pain flashes</em>.  
      For my future self, and for anyone in the same moment.  
      At times, we borrow the preparation of others to cross a hard pass.
